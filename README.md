# SchildiChat meta

This repo collects resources that relate to all SchildiChat clients at a single place.
Currently it's mainly for graphics.
This includes some icons retrieved from the specific application repos, but also some further working files, and also unused experiments.

Note: do not change files in `graphics-{android,desktop,web}` manually, but change them in their appropriate repos, and then run `fetch_icons.sh`!

You may also use this repo to open issues that are not specific to individual SchildiChat clients, but more the overall SchildiChat ecosystem.
